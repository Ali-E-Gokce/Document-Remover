# Document-Remover

I want to make a program that goes through all the pdf documents on your device, gives you a basic overview of the document, 
and then asks you if you want to keep the document or not. It will delete the document if you don't want it. It can be helpful if you
have a lot of pdf documents on your laptop you no longer need, and want to get rid of. 

Currently I only have code to print a summary of and information about a pdf document.
